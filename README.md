I used to enjoy computer games when I was a kid. I come from a low-income family, so sometimes all I had access to for leisure was simple and free computer games that could run on a browser. 

Once I grew up and realized this field was one I seriously wanted to enter, then I knew it would be a nice full-circle moment upon completion of this project. 

I had fun applying my programming knowledge and learning new things along the way. 

I expect to continously make additions to the game in order to make it more fun.
